# Image Classification of 3d printer models.
## Overview
A project in progress.  I am learning more about Tensorflow through an image classification NN.   
The purpose of this project is to classify the quality of prints from a 3D printer as good or bad quality.  The applications of this project could help manufacturers quickly identify and stop faulty machinery sooner.  By stopping bad production early, a company can reduce waste and maximize profit.  

## Current Status
1. Data clean to look for corrupt images or images not in JPG format.  
2. Data pipeline created through Tensorflow to import images into neural network training.  
3. Images have been scaled as a part of the preprocessing.
4. Separate training, validation, and test sets.
5. Train Neural network
6. Test Neural Network 

## Future steps
7. Clean up code for future use
